No dynamic creation of metadata schema. No additional tables. No preload fields values (users must fill manually).

The main aims of these metadata is to serve as basis (Data Provider) for OAI-PMH 2.0 Harvester implementations.

This Moodle's Block is written in PHP, following the Moodle Development/Contributions guidelines/recommendations.
