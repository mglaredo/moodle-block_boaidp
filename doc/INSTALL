Requirements:

    - Moodle 1.9+ and compliant Database
	OR
	- Moodle 2.5+ and compliant Database
	
Installation:

1. Untar to $(moodle_root_path)/blocks.
   (e.g. tar -zxvf boaidp.tar.gz)

2. Stablish the correct permissions for web server access for the block's directory 
    tree.
   (e.g. apache user; chown -R apache:apache blocks/boaidp) 

3. Navigate to your Moodle site and login as Admin, by means your favorite 
    internet browser.

4. In the Site Admin Block, click on the notifications link and review there 
    isn't any fail or problem message and the database tables are installed correctly.

FAQ: 

1. Is this block able to harvest OAI records? No so far, this block is only focus on 
	storing OAI records associated with each moodle course.
2. Is there any way to preload some OAI fields? On Moodle 1.9 version is automatic, but 
	so far on Moodle 2.x we	only let manual load by configuring each block instance 
	within its course.


Any comments are welcome.
